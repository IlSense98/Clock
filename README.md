# Clock

Clock is a Swift-based project that aims to replicate the functionality of Apple's native Clock application. The app includes features such as alarms, timers, stopwatches with lap functionality, and world clock capabilities. This is my first project in Swift.

## Features

- **Alarms**: Set multiple alarms with customizable notification sounds and repeat intervals.
- **Timers**: Create and manage timers with adjustable durations.
- **Stopwatch**: A fully functional stopwatch with the ability to record lap times.
- **World Clock**: Display the current date and time for various locations around the world.
